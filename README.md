# PFL-Apart

Apart is a board-game in which the goal is to distribute your pieces.

### Setup

- **Board Configuration:** Utilize an 8x8 grid for a game.
- **Piece Placement:** Each player controls 12 pieces. White pieces occupy two rows of 6 at one edge of the board, flanked by empty spaces. Symmetrically opposite, the black pieces mirror this setup.

### Key Definitions

- **Line:** An unbroken, straight alignment of same-color pieces, oriented vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- **Length of Line:** A count of pieces constituting a line.
- **Single Step:** A move to an immediately adjacent square, regardless of direction.
- **Jump:** A move spanning two or more squares.

### Gameplay Dynamics

Players alternate turns, initiating with the player controlling the white pieces. Note: The first move of the game cannot engage a continuous jump.

### Tactical Movement

- **Direction & Distance:** Pieces shift along their respective line, traveling a distance corresponding to its length.
- **Jump Mechanics:** Pieces can leap over others, capturing any opponent's piece upon landing. Players cannot move their pieces to squares already occupied by another one of their own pieces.
- **Multijumps:** A piece may execute multiple jumps during a move without landing on its starting square. Engaging in continuous jumps is optional and can be halted at any point.

### Culmination of the Game

Victory is achieved when a player successfully places all their pieces non-adjacent to friendly pieces, horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
